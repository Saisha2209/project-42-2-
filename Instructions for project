*Preload all the required images for the project in preload( ).
*Add a background image to canvas.
*Declare iss, spacecraft and hasDocked variables.
*Assign false to hasDocked variable.
*Create iss sprite in setup( ):
*Add animation to the iss sprite and scale the image.
*Create spacecraft sprite in setup( ):
*Add animation to the spacecraft sprite and scale the image.
*Write this below given condition in draw( ):
if (!hasDocked){
    //write code to set random x position for spacecraft
}
*Inside this condition set a random X position between some range for the spacecraft.
*Write all the keyEvents condition inside this if(!hasDocked) condition.
*When the left arrow is pressed:
Show image with the left side jet smoke.
Move the spacecraft in the left direction a little bit.
*When the right arrow is pressed:
Show image with the right side jet smoke.
Move the spacecraft in the left direction a little bit.
*When the down arrow is pressed:
Show image with both side jet smoke.
No downward movements will be added here for spacecraft.
*Write a condition using UP_ARROW key:
To move spacecraft towards ISS.
*Also, write a condition to check if the spacecraft reaches the docking position of ISS as shown in the image below.

*Once the spacecraft touches that point, set the hasDocked value as true.
*Show text that says “Docking Successful!”.
*“Run” your code to check if it works as expected.
*Find bugs and ﬁx them.




Background INFO- 
Crew Dragon Capsule: It is a crewed space capsule designed by SpaceX to ferry crews to the International space station.
Boeing Starliner: It is a class of reusable crew capsules expected to transport crew to the International Space Station (ISS) and other low-Earth orbit destinations.


Hints:
To check if the docking is successful, make sure you write conditions for checking spacecraft position with respect to ISS’ x and y positions.
